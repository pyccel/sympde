We develop a family of finite element spaces of differential forms
defined on cubical meshes in any number of dimensions.  The family
contains elements of all polynomial degrees and all form degrees.
In two dimensions, these include the serendipity finite elements and the
rectangular BDM elements.  In three dimensions they include a recent
generalization of the serendipity spaces, and new H(curl) and H(div)
finite element spaces.  Spaces in the family can be combined to give
finite element subcomplexes of the de Rham complex which satisfy the basic
hypotheses of the finite element exterior calculus, and hence can be used
for stable discretization of a variety of problems.  The construction
and properties of the spaces are established in a uniform manner using
finite element exterior calculus.

This article reports on the confluence of two streams of research,
one emanating from the fields of numerical analysis and scientific
computation, the other from topology and geometry.  In it we consider
the numerical discretization of partial differential equations that
are related to differential complexes so that de~Rham cohomology
and Hodge theory are key tools for exploring the well-posedness of
the continuous problem.  The discretization methods we consider are
finite element methods, in which a variational or weak formulation of
the PDE problem is approximated by restricting the trial subspace to
an appropriately constructed piecewise polynomial subspace.  After a
brief introduction to finite element methods, we develop an abstract
Hilbert space framework for analyzing the stability and convergence of
such discretizations.  In this framework, the differential complex is
represented by a complex of Hilbert spaces and stability is obtained by
transferring Hodge theoretic structures that ensure well-posedness of the
continuous problem from the continuous level to the discrete.  We show
stable discretization discretization is achieved if the finite element
spaces satisfy two hypotheses: they can be arranged into a subcomplex
of this Hilbert complex, and there exists a bounded cochain projection
from that complex to the subcomplex.  In the next part of the paper, we
consider the most canonical example of the abstract theory, in which the
Hilbert complex is the de~Rham complex of a domain in Euclidean space.
We use the Koszul complex to construct two families of finite element
differential forms, show that these can be arranged in subcomplexes of
the de~Rham complex in numerous ways, and for each construct a bounded
cochain projection.   The abstract theory therefore applies to give the
stability and convergence of finite element approximations of the Hodge
Laplacian.  Other applications are considered as well, especially the
elasticity complex and its application to the equations of elasticity.
Background material is included to make the presentation self-contained
for a variety of readers.

A differential form is a field which assigns to each point
of a domain an alternating multilinear form on its tangent space.
The exterior derivative operation, which  maps differential forms  to
differential forms of the next higher order, unifies the basic first order
differential operators of calculus, and is a building block for a great
variety of differential equations.  When discretizing such differential
equations by finite element methods, stable discretization depends
on the development of spaces of finite element differential forms.
As revealed recently through the finite element exterior calculus,
for each order of differential form, there are two natural families
of finite element subspaces associated to a simplicial triangulation.
In the case of forms of order zero, which are simply functions, these two
families reduce to one, which is simply the well-known family of Lagrange
finite element subspaces of the first order Sobolev space.  For forms
of degree $1$ and of degree $n-1$ (where $n$ is the space dimension),
we obtain two natural families of finite element subspaces, unifying many
of the known mixed finite element spaces developed over the last decades.

A close connection between the ordinary de Rham complex
and a corresponding elasticity complex is utilized to derive new mixed
finite element methods for linear elasticity. For a formulation with
weakly imposed symmetry, this approach leads to  methods which are
simpler than those previously obtained. For example, we construct
stable discretizations which use only piecewise linear elements to
approximate the stress field and piecewise constant functions to
approximate the displacement field. We also discuss how the strongly
symmetric methods proposed in [8] can be derived in the present
framework. The method of construction works in both two and three space
dimensions, but for simplicity the discussion here is limited to the
two dimensional case.

Finite element exterior calculus is an approach to the
design and understanding of finite element discretizations for a wide
variety of systems of partial differential equations.  This approach
brings to bear tools from differential geometry, algebraic topology,
and homological algebra to develop discretizations which are compatible
with the geometric, topological, and algebraic structures which
underlie well-posedness of the PDE problem being solved.  In the finite
element exterior calculus, many finite element spaces are revealed as
spaces of piecewise polynomial differential forms.  These connect to
each other in discrete subcomplexes of elliptic differential complexes,
and are also related to the continuous elliptic complex through
projections which commute with the complex differential. Applications
are made to the finite element discretization of a variety of problems,
including the Hodge Laplacian, Maxwell's equations, the equations of
elasticity, and elliptic eigenvalue problems, and also to
preconditioners.
